# UiUx Internship Code Challenge - 22nd May 2018
## Due: 23rd 9:00am May or Earlier


##### Sign up on AfricasTalking and get an API Key, create an app and send a message from the app to a mobile phone (in this case, simulator).

## Resources
- [API Reference](http://docs.africastalking.com/)
- [Helper libraries](https://github.com/AfricasTalkingLtd)
- [Sandbox](https://account.africastalking.com/apps/sandbox)
- [Simulator](https://simulator.africastalking.com:1517/)

## Tips
###### After signup, navigate to the sandbox(big orange button) which youâ€™ll use to build your test app. Your API key is in settings. A link to the simulator is also in the sandbox.

###### You are free to build using any language, using the available SDKs or the API directly. We advise building a clean simple form that submits the message recipients and message text as well as display responses from the API. 

###### The documentation is your friend. Carefully go through it, learn how the API works

###### Extra points for good user experience, form validation and well implemented code!
